"""Git Signoff Attestation (GSA) verifier — stdlib-only, single file.

Verifies GSA v1.0 attestations (skills/git-signoff/specs/gsa-core.md) against a
repository's history using the §5.1 lookup order: git notes
(refs/notes/signoff) on the commit and its tree, then [SIGNOFF *]
attestation commits in the log, with the tree-SHA fallback for squash
merges and rebases.

Two modes:

  head     Verify that a specific commit (default HEAD) is attested — the
           PR-gate check. A commit that is itself an attestation commit
           passes when it is empty (same tree as its parent) and attests
           its own parent's commit and tree (the normal shape of a branch
           ending in /git-signoff); a non-empty attestation commit fails, so
           trailers cannot smuggle unreviewed changes past the gate.
           For 2-parent merge commits (e.g. GitHub standard PR merges),
           verifies that HEAD^{tree} cleanly matches git merge-tree HEAD^1 HEAD^2
           and that the merged PR head HEAD^2 is validly attested.
  history  Verify that a ref's history carries valid attestations — the
           repo-badge check. Passes when at least --require valid
           attestations (default 1) are found.

Evidence, not trailers (verify-v1.5). An attestation *commit* found by the
log lookup — in the target's own history or under --scan-refs — counts only
if the commit object corroborates its trailers: exactly one parent, empty
(its tree is the parent's), and that parent is the declared reviewed commit;
its declared tree anchors only when it is the parent's actual tree. Without
this, an empty [SIGNOFF] commit on an unrelated tree whose trailer named some
target's tree would pass that target. Notes are judged as before: they are
statements attached to the very object being verified.

  --scan-refs REF [REF ...]   head mode: also consider sound attestation
           commits reachable from these refs (pull-request head refs the
           composite action fetched for the merged PR associated with the
           target). A match by tree establishes that the same tracked code
           state was attested — not that this pull request, base, or
           interview context was reviewed (gsa-core §5.1). Which refs are
           eligible is the caller's decision (verify/action.yml: merged,
           same-repository PRs); the verifier trusts no ref it was not given.

Exit 0 on pass, 1 on fail. No dependencies beyond Python 3.10+ and git;
copy this file anywhere or run it via the companion composite action
(verify/action.yml in the git-signoff repository). The file is vendored into
adopter repositories as part of the skill folder, so `--audit` runs locally
without a download, and the producer helper (attest.py, same folder) imports
it to self-check every attestation it writes.

Environment:

  GIT_SIGNOFF_TRANSCRIPT_FILE   --audit: transcript file to hash instead of the
                                harness-resolved path.
  GIT_SIGNOFF_NO_UPDATE_CHECK   set to 1 to skip the stale-pin warning below.
  GIT_SIGNOFF_PIN_REMOTE        repository URL queried for verify-v* tags
                                (tests point it at a local bare repo).

Stale-pin warning: after fetching notes, the verifier lists the verify-v*
tags on the upstream repository and prints a one-line warning to stderr when
a newer pin than VERIFIER_PIN exists (stdout carries only the verdict). It
never changes the verdict and is skipped silently on any network failure.

Single-valued trailers appear exactly once per attestation (gsa-core §2.3):
a commit message or note block that repeats one — the way a line break
inside free text would smuggle a second Reviewed-Tree-SHA — is malformed
and never anchors anything. cat_sort_uniq-merged notes, whose blocks cannot
be separated, anchor only the object they are attached to.

Verification is non-destructive to your signoff notes: origin's notes are
fetched into an isolated mirror ref, never into refs/notes/signoff, so an
attestation you have not pushed yet survives a verifier run.

    # commit is gone, and a stale attestation merged in (a note git copied onto
    # a rebased commit) is indistinguishable from a live one. So a blob counts

    # names exactly one reviewed tree and hangs on it (or on a commit that has
    # it) — then every attestation merged in declared that tree, and the blob
