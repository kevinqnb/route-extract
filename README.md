# route-extract

Benchmarking routing, cascade, and scheduling strategies for information
extraction -- methods that take a collection of extraction models (LLMs or
smaller NLP models) and decide, per document or per field, which model(s) to
call, trading accuracy against efficiency.

## Data

[VRDU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15421) ("A Benchmark for Structured
Extractions from Complex Documents", Wang et al.): FCC political ad-buy forms
and FARA foreign-agent registration forms, with OCR text and human-annotated
field spans.

- Original dataset: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/vrdu
- Original evaluator (match functions ported into
  `src/route_extract/datasets/matching.py`, cited there):
  https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/vrdu

Run `uv run data/download_vrdu.py` to download and reshape it into
`data/vrdu/` (gitignored; see `data/README.md`).

## Methods

Benchmarks strategies from the following papers, each via its own adapter in
`src/route_extract/extractors/`:

Every method fits against the same profiling table -- see `CLAUDE.md` for the
design and current implementation status.

## Development
* `/devlog` run after a build to log prompt and implementation details to the devlog directory
* `/signoff` run before opening a PR to audit and verify code with claude before pushing
